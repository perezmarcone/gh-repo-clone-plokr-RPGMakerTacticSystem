# RPG Maker Tactic System for MZ
[Tactics System from Belmoussaoui](https://github.com/belmoussaoui/Tactics-System) is a tactical battle system plugin for RPG Maker MV.
I ported the script for RPG Maker MV to RPG Maker MZ and fixed some bugs also.
You can see a [video of the plugin on YouTube](https://youtu.be/oa1Xu39slKU).

## Documentation
I updated the Plugin @Help description which can also accessed in RPG Maker MZ. In addition, you find a thread about this plugin in the [RPG Maker Forum](https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/).
You find a sample project in the 'TacticsMZ.zip'. Create a new RPG Maker MZ project and copy (overwrite) all files in to the new project folder. In addition, you find the sample project as [web browser game on itch.io]() .

## License
This plugin is licensed under MIT - the same as the MV plugin. See also the [license.md](https://github.com/plokr/RPGMakerTacticSystem/blob/main/LICENSE) file.
