# RPG Maker Tactic System for MZ
[Tactics System from Belmoussaoui](https://github.com/belmoussaoui/Tactics-System) is a tactical battle system plugin for RPG Maker MV.
I ported the script for RPG Maker MV to RPG Maker MZ and fixed some bugs also.
You can see a [video of the plugin on YouTube](https://youtu.be/oa1Xu39slKU).

## Documentation
I updated the Plugin @Help description which can also accessed in RPG Maker MZ. In addition, you find a thread about this plugin in the [RPG Maker Forum](https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/tactics-system-1-2-mz-port.152645/).
You find a sample project in the 'TacticsMZ.zip'. Create a new RPG Maker MZ project and copy (overwrite) all files in to the new project folder. In addition, you find the sample project as [web browser game on itch.io](https://plokr.itch.io/rpg-maker-mz-tactics-system-demo) .

In addtion, I ported the CombatSystem plugin which shows the Battleground for each of the attacks (Tactics_Combat.js). Please copy the content of the Combat_System.zip into the demo project folder to update it.
