# RPG Maker Tactic System for MZ
[Tactics System from Belmoussaoui](https://github.com/belmoussaoui/Tactics-System) is a tactical battle system plugin for RPG Maker MV.
I ported the script for RPG Maker MV to RPG Maker MZ and fixed some bugs also.
You can see a [video of the plugin on YouTube](https://youtu.be/oa1Xu39slKU).

##Documentation
I updated the Plugin @Help description which can also accessed in RPG Maker MZ. In addition, you can find a thread about this plugin in the [RPG Maker Forum](https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/).

##License
This plugin is licensed under MIT - the same as the MV plugin. See also the license-md file.
